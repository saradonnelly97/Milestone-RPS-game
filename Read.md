# MILESTONE Rock Paper Scissors Shoot Browser Game

## This is a project where I will create a game that is played via the internet using a web browser. 

To run this game,  I created three files: index.html, style.css, and index.js. Once the  file opens in a web browser, and you should see the Rock, Paper, Scissors game interface. Click on one of the buttons to make your choice, and the result will be displayed. You can click the "Restart" button to play again.

This implementation uses HTML to structure the game interface, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for game logic and interactivity.

## Watch the tutorial below to learn how this game works
